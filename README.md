CREATING a GATSBY LEAFLET STARTER
(1) gatsby new directory_name
(2) cd directory_name
(3) yarn develop
(4) chrome on localhost:8000    (should see the (gatsby astronaut...)

######################################
(5) download from https://github.com/13rianlucero/Covid_Dashboard
(6) manually replace the file by file, or folder by folder, as appropriate
try to run this again
(7) yarn develop (it fails, it wants sass)
######################################

(8) npm install sass --legacy-peer-deps
and after a few warnings, it will run
(9) yarn add charts.css This is for the chart css files
(10) yarn develop   (one more time, you should now see a gatsby leaflet map, 
                    with an astronaut centered on Washington, D.C.)
